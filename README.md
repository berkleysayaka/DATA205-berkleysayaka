# DATA205- Capstone project 
The primary objective of this project is to expand the existing collection of analysis examples within the Data Science Kit. 
This plojct is in collaboration with the Capstone Project of the Montgomery community College 2024 Fall intern program.



# Course Summary: DATA 205

DATA 205 course is designed to provide students with the understanding of fundamental concepts and hands-on experience as a data scientist. In addition to the more conventional models of learning, this course creates a multi-professional setting where students are permitted to learn in parallel with real-life practicing professionals, thus introducing them to practical approaches to using Big Data.
Project-based learning approach can be said to be one of the main traits of DATA 205. Students are not just consumers of these details, but rather stakeholders involved in the data science decisions. As students perform various tasks with real-world data, they learn how to utilize and analyze data using many methods and determine the ethical use of data, as well as create reproducible research results.



# Capstone Project Overview

1. Work with a mentor and data to create a “data product”
2. Special Projects
3. Opportunity to work with external organization
4. Internal Projects
5. Defined in collaboration with the instructor



# Dataset requirements

1. Must access data from an original data source
2. Not from Kaggle or another aggregator, unless you can trace the data back to its primary source and access it there
3. Must choose and use data in a manner consistent with any licensing or usage restrictions
4. Must use real-world data (not synthetic data)
5. Must work with at least 2 quantitative (numerical) and 2 qualitative (categorical) variables
6. Must not be data you worked with in a previous DATA course
7. There may be exceptions; instructor approval is required
8. Additional data requirements will be discussed as you refine your project ideas



# Project Expectations

1. Choice of Topics & Datasets
2. Elevator Pitch
3. Data Ingestion, Cleaning, & Wrangling
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Statistical Analysis
6. Data Visualizations
7. Data Product / Data Stories
8. GitHub Presence!
